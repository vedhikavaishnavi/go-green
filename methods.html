					<td style="text-decoration:none;color:#4a5a43;font-size:34px">Paper is used everywhere, but its heavy use harms the environment. Switching to digital tools for schoolwork, office tasks, and daily reminders reduces printing and saves paper, ink, and energy. When printing is necessary, using the double-sided setting is an easy way to cut paper use in half. Reusing single-sided sheets for notes or rough work also reduces waste. Food-soiled paper that can’t be recycled can still be composted, helping lower landfill waste and methane emissions. By going digital, printing double-sided, reusing sheets, and composting, individuals can meaningfully reduce paper waste without losing convenience.</td>

				<tr>
					<td style="text-decoration:none;color:#4a5a43;font-size:34px">Plastic is everywhere because it’s cheap and durable, but it takes centuries to decompose and harms ecosystems, making waste reduction essential. Reusing plastic bags, containers, and bottles helps cut down single-use waste with almost no effort. Choosing items with less plastic packaging — like loose produce or products in paper, glass, or biodegradable materials — also reduces unnecessary plastic. Recycling plastics correctly ensures they can be processed instead of ending up in landfills. Whenever possible, switching to biodegradable alternatives such as cornstarch or bamboo products lowers long-term impact. By reusing, shopping mindfully, recycling, and choosing eco-friendly options, individuals can meaningfully reduce their plastic footprint.</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="text-decoration:none;color:#4a5a43;font-size:34px">Small habits may seem insignificant, but when adopted by entire communities, their impact becomes huge. One person saving a few sheets of paper or reusing a few plastic bags makes a small difference, but hundreds of people doing the same can save thousands of sheets and divert millions of bags from landfills. These changes are effective because they are simple and don’t require major lifestyle sacrifices — just smarter, more mindful versions of what people already do. Over time, these small shifts create a culture of sustainability where caring for the environment becomes a natural part of everyday life.</td>
